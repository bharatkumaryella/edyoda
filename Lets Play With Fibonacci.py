# Write a Python program to get the Fibonacci series between 0 to 50



# Note : The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers :

# 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ....

# Every next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it.

# Expected Output : 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34


a=0
b=1

while b<50:
    print(b,end=" ")
    
    a,b=b,b+a
